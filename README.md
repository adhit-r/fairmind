> **Building the future of ethical AI, one model at a time** 🚀

FairMind is an open-source platform that empowers developers to build AI systems that are **fair**, **transparent**, and **accountable**. We provide comprehensive tools for AI governance, bias detection, and ethical AI development.

## 🌟 Why FairMind?

- **🔍 Bias Detection**: Real-time bias analysis with 20+ fairness metrics
- **📊 AI Bill of Materials**: Complete component tracking and provenance
- **🛡️ Security First**: OWASP AI security guidelines implementation
- **📈 Model Registry**: Version control and management for AI models
- **⚖️ Compliance Ready**: GDPR and AI Act compliance automation
- **🤝 Open Source**: Built by the community, for the community

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/radhi1991/fairmind.git
cd fairmind

# Start with our sample models
cd models
# Explore healthcare, financial, and e-commerce AI models

# Or jump into development
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 🎯 What We're Building

### 🤖 AI Bill of Materials (AI BOM)
Track and manage every component of your AI system with our comprehensive AI BOM framework.

```python
# Example: Create an AI BOM
from api.models.ai_bom import AIBOMRequest, AIBOMComponent

bom_request = AIBOMRequest(
    project_name="Credit Risk Model",
    components=[
        AIBOMComponent(
            name="XGBoost Classifier",
            type="ML_MODEL",
            version="1.2.0",
            risk_level="MEDIUM"
        )
    ]
)
```

### 🔍 Bias Detection & Fairness Analysis
Detect and mitigate bias in your AI models with our advanced fairness analysis tools.

```python
# Example: Analyze model fairness
from api.services.fairness_analysis import FairnessAnalyzer

analyzer = FairnessAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_model(
    model=your_model,
    data=your_data,
    sensitive_features=['gender', 'age', 'race']
)
```

### 📊 Model Registry & Governance
Manage your AI models with version control, metadata tracking, and compliance monitoring.
