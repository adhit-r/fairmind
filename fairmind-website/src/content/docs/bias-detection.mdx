# Bias Detection Guide

Fairmind provides comprehensive bias detection capabilities to help you identify and mitigate bias in your AI models. This guide covers the various bias detection methods and how to use them effectively.

## Types of Bias Detection

### Statistical Parity
Statistical parity ensures that the proportion of positive predictions is the same across different demographic groups.

```python
from fairmind import BiasDetector

detector = BiasDetector()
results = detector.check_statistical_parity(
    model=your_model,
    dataset=your_dataset,
    sensitive_features=['gender', 'race']
)
```

### Demographic Parity
Demographic parity measures whether the model's predictions are independent of sensitive attributes.

### Equalized Odds
Equalized odds ensures that the true positive and false positive rates are equal across groups.

## Custom Fairness Rules

Fairmind allows you to define custom fairness rules tailored to your specific use case:

```python
from fairmind import CustomFairnessRule

# Define a custom fairness rule
rule = CustomFairnessRule(
    name="custom_parity",
    description="Custom parity rule for our use case",
    function=lambda predictions, sensitive_features: custom_parity_check(predictions, sensitive_features)
)

# Apply the rule
results = detector.apply_custom_rule(rule, model, dataset)
```

## Bias Detection Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
Ensure your dataset includes:
- **Features**: Input variables for your model
- **Target**: The variable you're predicting
- **Sensitive Features**: Protected attributes (gender, race, age, etc.)

### 2. Model Analysis
Run bias detection on your trained model:

```python
# Comprehensive bias analysis
analysis = detector.comprehensive_analysis(
    model=model,
    dataset=dataset,
    sensitive_features=['gender', 'race', 'age'],
    methods=['statistical_parity', 'demographic_parity', 'equalized_odds']
)
```

### 3. Results Interpretation
Review the bias detection results:

- **Bias Scores**: Numerical measures of bias
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs showing bias patterns
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for bias mitigation

## Bias Mitigation Strategies

### Pre-processing
- **Reweighting**: Adjust sample weights to balance groups
- **Resampling**: Oversample or undersample to achieve balance

### In-processing
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Train with adversarial objectives
- **Constraint-based Methods**: Add fairness constraints during training

### Post-processing
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Modify decision thresholds per group
- **Calibration**: Calibrate predictions to reduce bias

## Real-world Example

Here's a complete example of bias detection for a credit scoring model:

```python
import pandas as pd
from fairmind import BiasDetector, BiasReport

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('credit_data.csv')

# Initialize bias detector
detector = BiasDetector()

# Run comprehensive bias analysis
report = detector.analyze_model(
    model=credit_model,
    dataset=data,
    sensitive_features=['gender', 'race'],
    target='loan_approved'
)

# Generate detailed report
report.generate_html('bias_report.html')
report.generate_pdf('bias_report.pdf')
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Early**: Include bias detection in your model development pipeline
2. **Multiple Methods**: Use various bias detection methods for comprehensive analysis
3. **Domain Expertise**: Consult with domain experts to understand context-specific bias
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for bias in production models
5. **Documentation**: Document your bias detection process and findings

## Advanced Features

### LLM-based Analysis
Fairmind supports LLM-based bias analysis for text and complex scenarios:

```python
# LLM-based bias analysis
llm_analysis = detector.llm_analysis(
    model=model,
    dataset=dataset,
    llm_provider='openai',
    analysis_type='comprehensive'
)
```

### Simulation-based Testing
Run bias simulations to test different scenarios:

```python
# Bias simulation
simulation = detector.run_simulation(
    model=model,
    scenarios=['demographic_shift', 'data_drift'],
    iterations=1000
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Sensitive Features**: Ensure your dataset includes all relevant protected attributes
2. **Small Sample Sizes**: Some bias detection methods require sufficient samples per group
3. **Data Quality**: Poor data quality can affect bias detection accuracy

### Performance Optimization

- Use sampling for large datasets
- Enable parallel processing for multiple analyses
- Cache results for repeated analyses
