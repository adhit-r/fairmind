# Getting Started with Fairmind

Welcome to Fairmind, a comprehensive AI governance platform that helps you build trustworthy AI systems. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Node.js 18 or higher**
- **Basic understanding of machine learning concepts**

## Quick Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fairmind-ethical-sandbox.git
cd fairmind-ethical-sandbox
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

## Your First Bias Detection

Now that you have Fairmind running, let's perform your first bias detection analysis:

1. **Navigate to the bias detection section**
2. **Upload your dataset or select a sample dataset**
3. **Configure your bias detection parameters**
4. **Run the analysis and review the results**

:::tip
Start with the sample datasets to understand how bias detection works before using your own data.
