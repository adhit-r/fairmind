# Fairmind Ethical Sandbox Product Website

This directory contains the source for the product website, which is intended to showcase the features, use cases, and visual highlights of the Fairmind Ethical Sandbox platform. The website is designed for marketing, documentation, and public awareness, and can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider.

## Structure

- `index.md` — Main landing page content (overview, value proposition)
- `features.md` — Detailed list and descriptions of platform features
- `usecases.md` — Example use cases and scenarios for the platform
- `screenshots/` — Screenshots and visual assets from the app

## How to Use

- Edit the markdown files to update the content for each section.
- Add screenshots or images to the `screenshots/` directory. Reference them in the markdown files as needed.
- The site can be converted to a static site (e.g., with Docusaurus, VitePress, or a static site generator) and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Deployment (Planned)

- The product website will be set up for deployment to GitHub Pages. Instructions and configuration will be added once the static site generator is chosen.

For now, use this directory to draft and organize all product-facing content and visuals.
