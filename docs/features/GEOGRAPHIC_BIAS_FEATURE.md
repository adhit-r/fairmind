# Geographic Bias Detection Feature

## Overview

The Geographic Bias Detection feature in FairMind addresses a critical AI governance challenge: **How well does a model trained in one country perform when deployed in another country?**

This is particularly important for:
- **Governments** deploying AI systems across different regions
- **Multinational corporations** using AI models globally
- **Regulatory compliance** ensuring fair treatment across borders
- **Risk assessment** for cross-country AI deployments

## Use Cases

### 1. Government/State Deployments
- **Credit Scoring**: Model trained in USA deployed in India
- **Fraud Detection**: UK model used in Brazil
- **Healthcare AI**: German model applied in Japan
- **Education Systems**: Australian model in developing countries

### 2. Business Applications
- **E-commerce**: Recommendation systems across cultures
- **Financial Services**: Risk assessment models globally
- **Healthcare**: Diagnostic AI across different populations
- **Legal AI**: Contract analysis across jurisdictions

#### 2. Dashboard Data
```http
GET /geographic-bias/dashboard
```

Returns comprehensive dashboard data including:
- Total models analyzed
- Models with geographic bias
- High-risk deployments
- Country performance metrics
- Recent analyses

### Frontend Component

The `GeographicBiasDetector` component provides:

1. **Input Form**:
   - Model ID
   - Source and target countries
   - Performance metrics
   - Cultural factors

2. **Analysis Results**:
   - Bias score (0-1 scale)
   - Performance drop percentage
   - Risk level assessment
   - Recommendations
   - Compliance issues
   - Cultural factors analysis

## Risk Levels

- **LOW** (0-0.3): Minimal bias, monitor regularly
- **MEDIUM** (0.3-0.5): Moderate bias, consider fine-tuning
- **HIGH** (0.5-0.7): Significant bias, requires intervention
- **CRITICAL** (0.7+): Severe bias, immediate action needed

## Cultural Factors Analyzed

1. **Language Differences**: Linguistic variations affecting model performance
2. **Economic Factors**: GDP, income levels, economic indicators
3. **Cultural Norms**: Social customs, traditions, behavioral patterns
4. **Regulatory Environment**: Data protection laws, AI regulations

## Compliance Considerations

### Legal Issues
- Equal treatment laws
- Anti-discrimination regulations
- Local AI governance frameworks
- Data protection compliance

### Ethical Concerns
- Fair treatment across populations
- Avoiding discriminatory outcomes
- Cultural sensitivity
- Transparency and accountability

## Recommendations Engine

### High Bias (Score > 0.5)
- Retrain model with target country data
- Implement local data collection strategy
- Consider federated learning approach
- Add cultural adaptation layers

### Medium Bias (Score 0.3-0.5)
- Fine-tune model with local data
- Implement bias monitoring
- Add cultural context features

### Low Bias (Score < 0.3)
- Monitor performance regularly
- Track cultural factor changes
- Maintain documentation

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Credit Scoring Model
- **Source**: USA (85% accuracy)
- **Target**: India (75% accuracy)
- **Bias Score**: 0.588 (HIGH)
- **Issues**: Language, economic differences, regulatory compliance
- **Recommendations**: Retrain with Indian data, add cultural context

### Scenario 2: Healthcare AI
- **Source**: Germany (90% accuracy)
- **Target**: Japan (88% accuracy)
- **Bias Score**: 0.2 (LOW)
- **Issues**: Minimal, monitor cultural factors
- **Recommendations**: Regular monitoring, document cultural differences

### Scenario 3: E-commerce Recommendations
- **Source**: USA (82% accuracy)
- **Target**: Japan (65% accuracy)
- **Bias Score**: 0.89 (CRITICAL)
- **Issues**: Cultural norms, language, economic factors
- **Recommendations**: Complete retraining, cultural adaptation
