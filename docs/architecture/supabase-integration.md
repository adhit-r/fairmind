# Supabase BaaS Integration Architecture

## Overview
This document describes how Supabase BaaS will be integrated into the Fairmind Ethical Sandbox project.

## Key Components

### 1. Authentication
- **Supabase Auth** for user management
- **JWT** for session management
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data access control

### 2. Database
- **PostgreSQL** with Supabase's management interface
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for fine-grained access control
- **Database Functions** for complex queries and operations

### 3. Storage
- **File storage** for user uploads and application assets
- **Access control** through storage policies

### 4. Edge Functions
- **Custom backend logic** in TypeScript
- **Scheduled tasks** for periodic operations
- **Webhook handlers** for third-party integrations

## Data Flow

### Frontend to Supabase
1. User interacts with Next.js frontend
2. Frontend makes requests to Supabase client
3. Supabase client handles authentication and request signing
4. Supabase enforces RLS policies
5. Data is returned to frontend

### Real-time Updates
1. Frontend subscribes to database changes
2. Supabase pushes updates to subscribed clients
3. Frontend UI updates in real-time

## Security Model

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- Social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Magic links
- JWT-based sessions

### Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- User roles and permissions
- Custom claims in JWT tokens

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Coexistence
- Run Supabase alongside existing NestJS backend
- Gradually migrate features to Supabase
- Use feature flags to control access to new implementation

### Phase 2: Transition
- Redirect traffic from NestJS to Supabase
- Monitor performance and fix issues
- Keep NestJS as fallback

### Phase 3: Decommission
- Remove NestJS dependencies
- Clean up unused code
- Update documentation

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Supabase logs and custom logging
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and error tracking
- **Backups**: Automated database backups
- **Scaling**: Vertical and horizontal scaling as needed

## Best Practices
- Use Supabase client in React hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow security best practices
- Document all custom functions and policies
